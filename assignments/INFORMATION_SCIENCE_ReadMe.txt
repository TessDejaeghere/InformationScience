LIMITATIONS!
----------------------------------
Please know that we have a lot of other exam projects which are difficult and time-consuming.
I did everything I could to get a result that worked, but sadly I had to take the time
limitations into account. :(

> The app will fail if the author name contains extended ASCII. I tried everything,
nothing worked.

> The full title has to be typed by the user according to how it's present in the database.
There are no clear rules regarding capitalization for these titles. Sometimes the small words such as
'and', 'the', or 'upon' were capitalized, sometimes they weren't. 
Consequently, I was unable to format the titles 100% correctly, 
and I chose to let the user search for the full title as it is present in the database. 

	E.g.: "Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows" will return a correct result,
	while "harry potter and the deathly hallows" will not.
